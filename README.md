# mothur

Welcome to the mothur project, initiated by Dr. Patrick Schloss and his software development team in the Department of Microbiology &amp; Immunology at The University of Michigan. This project seeks to develop a single piece of open-source, expandable software to fill the bioinformatics needs of the microbial ecology community. mothur is available under the GPL license.

## Getting Started
